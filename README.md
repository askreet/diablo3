About
=====

This Gem is a work in progress for the [Diablo 3 API].  Currently, you can gather
heroes and item basics about what they have equipped.

See the test directory for some basic examples.  If you're good with Ruby,
I'd be happy to have someone help me implement all the features of the API.

Contributing
------------

1. This gem now requires Ruby2.0 and should use keyword arguments where
   appropriate.
2. Code should conform to ruby-style-guide and pass Rubocop standards. Run
   `rake spec`before sending a pull request.

Other than that, just send a pull request and I will try to respond as quickly
as possible.
